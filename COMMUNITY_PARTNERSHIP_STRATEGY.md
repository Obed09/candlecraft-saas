## 📧 Outreach Templates

### Email Template 1: Direct Community Owner Approach

**Subject:** Partnership opportunity for [Community Name] members

---

Hi [Name],

I've been following [Community Name] for a while and I'm impressed by how engaged your members are around building profitable candle businesses.

I'm reaching out because we've built something I think could add massive value to your community - and create a new revenue stream for you.

**What we built:**
CandleFlow is the first all-in-one business management platform built specifically for candle makers. Think of it as their "operating system" for managing recipes, inventory, costing, orders, and production planning.

**Why this matters for your community:**
Your members are already asking questions about pricing, inventory tracking, and managing growth. Right now, they're using spreadsheets and sticky notes. We've solved this with software that actually understands the candle business.

**The partnership opportunity:**
I'd like to offer your community exclusive founder pricing ($19/mo vs regular $39/mo) and give you **25% recurring commission on every referral** - for life.

If 100 of your members sign up, that's **$475/month passive income** for you, while your community gets a tool that actually helps them succeed.

**What I'm proposing:**
- 15-minute call to show you the platform
- Custom landing page for your community with special pricing
- You decide if it's a good fit for your members
- Zero pressure, zero risk

Would you be open to a quick demo this week? I'm free [Day] at [Time] or [Day] at [Time].

Looking forward to connecting,

[Your Name]
[Your Title]
CandleFlow
[Phone] • [Email]

P.S. - We're limiting founder pricing to the first 1,000 users. If your community is interested, now is the perfect time to lock in these rates.

### Email Template 2: Follow-Up (3 days after no response)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Community Name]

---

Hi [Name],

I sent you a note earlier this week about a partnership opportunity for [Community Name].

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief:

**One question:** Would your community benefit from a tool that helps candle makers:
- Calculate exact product costs in 30 seconds?
- Track inventory automatically?
- Generate professional invoices?
- Plan production based on orders?

If yes, let's chat. If no, no worries - I won't bug you again.

## 📱 Social Media Outreach Script (DM Approach)

### LinkedIn/Instagram DM Template

---

Hey [Name]! 👋

Love what you're doing with [Community Name] - your content on [specific topic] really resonated with me.

Quick question: Are your members asking about how to manage their candle businesses better? (Pricing, inventory, orders, etc.?)

## 🛡️ Objection Handling Guide

### Objection 1: "My community doesn't like being sold to"
**Response:** 
"I totally understand - and that's exactly why this works. You're not selling them anything. You're giving them exclusive access to a tool that solves real problems they already have. Position it as a benefit you negotiated for them, not a sales pitch."

### Objection 2: "I don't have time to promote this"
**Response:**
"That's exactly why we provide everything done-for-you. One email. One Facebook post. One Instagram story. That's it. We've written it all for you - just copy, paste, and send. Takes 15 minutes total."

### Objection 3: "What if my members don't like it?"
**Response:**
"We offer a 60-day money-back guarantee, so there's zero risk for them. Plus, you get to try it free with an Enterprise account before recommending it. If you don't love it, don't promote it."

### Objection 4: "My members won't pay for software"
**Response:**
"I hear you, but here's what we're seeing: Candle makers are already paying for courses, supplies, and business coaching. $19/mo is less than one candle supply order. Plus, the cost calculator alone typically saves them $50-100/mo in material waste."

### Objection 5: "I need to think about it"
**Response:**
"Absolutely! How about this: Let me send you a free Enterprise account so you can test it yourself. Use it for a week, and then decide if it's right for your community. Sound fair?"

### Objection 6: "I've done partnerships before and they didn't work"
**Response:**
"What happened? [Listen] That makes sense. Here's what's different: We're not asking you to do webinars or ongoing promotion. One announcement to your community, and we take it from there. Plus, you can track every click and commission in real-time."

## 📞 Quick Reference: What to Say When...

**When they ask about competition:**
"There literally isn't one. We're the first software built specifically for candle makers. Candle makers are using Square for inventory, Excel for recipes, and sticky notes for production. We're bringing it all together."

**When they ask about pricing:**
"Your community gets founder pricing at $19/mo - normally $39. This locks in forever. You get 25% of that, which is $4.75/user/month recurring. If 50 of your members join, that's $237/month passive income for you."

**When they want proof it works:**
"We've had 353 candle makers join in our first 30 days. [Share specific testimonial]. We're also working with [Partner Name] and [Partner Name 2] who are seeing great results."

**When they're worried about reputation:**
"I get it - your reputation is everything. That's why we offer a 60-day money-back guarantee. If anyone in your community isn't happy, they get a full refund. Plus, you can try the software yourself first with a free Enterprise account before recommending it."

---

## 🚀 Go-To-Market Timeline

**Week 1-2:** Build partner list + research
**Week 3-4:** First outreach wave (10 partners)

**Week 9-10:** Optimize based on learnings + add 5 more
**Week 11-12:** Scale to 15 total partners

**Month 4+:** Maintain and optimize existing partnerships, selectively add new ones

---

## 📝 Final Thoughts

**The Big Idea:**
You're not asking for a favor. You're offering community owners:
1. Passive recurring income
2. A tool that makes their members more successful
3. Zero effort on their part (you do everything)

**The Mindset:**
You're solving TWO problems:
- Community members need better tools (you have it)
- Community owners need new revenue streams (you provide it)

This is a **win-win-win:** Members win, Partners win, You win.
